A simple web scraper I made that requires SQLite, along with dependencies listed  at the top of the src file
It requires input for a certain resturant, outputs labeled nutritional data to a database
There are quite a few .replace() and .split()'s due to bs4 parsing
decided to do alot of checking rather than minimal
